==================
wxPython "Classic"
==================

This is the source tree for wxPython, a set of wrapper modules that enable
the use of wxWidgets from the Python language. This is the "Classic" or
legacy version of wxPython, **ALL** new development is happening in the `"Phoenix"
version of wxPython`__, which is from the ground up reimplementation of much
of the foundation of wxPython.

See docs/BUILD.txt for build instructions.
